This is a submission by Kenrick Tse (kt1556) for Lab 2 of Operating Systems, CSCI 202, Fall 2018.

The source code for the lab is all contained in one file, scheduler.py. 
However, the program requires random-numbers.txt and your selected input text file to be in the same directory.
The version used is Python 3.7, and requires no external libraries (though it uses sys and copy, which are part of the standard library).

=================================================================================

Compiling and Running:

While in the directory of the file, type in command prompt:
python scheduler.py <input-filename>

The output should be printed to the screen straight away. Alternatively, for detailed output, type the following:
python scheduler.py --verbose <input-filename>
